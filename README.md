Introduction

The Windows Registry is a critical database for configuration settings and options on Windows operating systems. Malware often uses registry entries to persist across reboots, modify system behavior, or hide its presence. Understanding how the registry works is vital for detecting and mitigating malware threats.
Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need:

    A Windows environment for testing
    Basic knowledge of PowerShell or Python
    Administrative privileges for registry access

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/alex14324/Registry.git
cd Registry


Key Concepts

    Registry Structure: Learn about the hierarchy of keys and values.
    Common Registry Locations: Explore locations frequently targeted by malware (e.g., HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE).
    Persistence Mechanisms: Understand how malware uses the registry to achieve persistence.

Example Scripts

This section contains example scripts for educational purposes:

    Registry Viewer: A simple script to view specific registry keys.
        PowerShell: view-registry.ps1
        Python: view_registry.py

    Persistence Checker: A script to check for common persistence mechanisms in the registry.
        PowerShell: check-persistence.ps1

    Registry Cleanup: A script to remove suspicious entries.
        PowerShell: cleanup-registry.ps1

    Note: Always test scripts in a controlled environment.
